  ## Usage
  
  ### With Route 53 Record Creation
  
  This module will automatically create the DNS records if a value for `route53_zone_name` is provided in reference to an existing Route 53 zone within hte same AWS account.

  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/route_53/main.tf" }}
  ```
  
  > :warning: **Note:** CloudFront Distributions can take 10-15 minutes to become active after creation.
  
  ### Without Route 53 Record Creation
  
  By default, the module will not create a DNS record in Route 53 or certificate in ACM.
  
  A certificate must be created and validated before the relay can be created. This can be done manually or via Terraform (example below).
  
  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/without_route_53/cert.tf" }}
  ```
  
  Once the certificate is created, it must be validated before it can be used. The DNS validation information can be extracted from the Terraform state using the command below.
  
  ```bash
  terraform output relay_cert_dns_validation
  ```
  
  Create a DNS validation `CNAME` record that routes the `relay_cert_dns_validation.<relay_fqdn>.name` to the `relay_cert_dns_validation.<relay_fqdn>.record` value.
  Once the DNS record has been created, the certificate can take up to 15 minutes to become active. The status can be checked using the command below.
  
  ```bash
  aws acm list-certificates --query "CertificateSummaryList[?DomainName=='<relay_fqdn>'].Status" 
  ```
  
  Now that the certificate has been created and is active, the ARN can be passed into the module as seen below.
  
  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/without_route_53/main.tf" }}
  ```
  
  Once the resources have been successfully created, the final step is to create the CNAME of the CloudFront distribution which can be extracted from the Terraform state using the command below.
  
  ```bash
  terraform output relay_distribution_domain_name
  ```
  
  Create a `CNAME` DNS record that routes the `relay_fqdn` to the `relay_distribution_domain_name` found in the previous command.
  
  ### European Realm Target
  
  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/europe/main.tf" }}
  ```
  
  ### Validation
  Once an instance of the FullStory Relay has been successfully created, the health endpoint at `https://<relay_fqdn>/healthz` should return a `200 OK`.
